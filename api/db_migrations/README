# DB migrations

Use Alembic with this to automatically generate your migration configurations.

## Be aware of the limitations

Alembic's autogenerate functionality will come close to doing what you want it
to do, but it won't detect some things (e.g. renames will turn into drop + add,
which can be a real problem for production data).  Be sure to check your
migration script before running it.
